# Java-mySQL
This is a basic example of how to set a connexion to a MySQL database and retrieve data from it using the jdbc Api for MySQL and Java. 
A class "item" is also implemented, modelling the element that will be retrieved from the "products" table in the sample MySQL 
database "NorthWind". 
Using classes to model elements of database tables is a powerful practice when creating Apps that consult databases. This gains importance
in Scala, when this kind of classes are "case classes" and one can match them using pattern matching expressions.
